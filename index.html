          I was born in <i>Riverside</i>, California in June, 2005. My mom
          worked as an elementary school teacher and my dad has been a Senior
          Software Developer and Computer Programmer for over 30 years. I have a
          younger sister who is in high school. I have an Australian Labradoodle
          whose name is Charlie. I also have a Siberian cat named Stella. I was
          enrolled in a private, Christian school in Riverside during the
          entirety of my elementary, middle school, and high school years.
          During those years, I was taught <i>foundational</i>,
          <i>biblical principles and beliefs</i> that have shaped and molded my
          core values and character into who I am today.

          playing with Lego! I also really enjoy playing <i>basketball</i> and I
          have been playing the sport since the third grade. I enjoy playing
          <i>video games like Minecraft</i> to strengthen my imagination skills
          and push myself to higher limits. <i>Traveling</i> is also something
          that I love to do! My family and I have been to many popular and
          beautiful destinations listed below. Some things I have experienced
          from these places include zip-lining, snorkeling, and whitewater
          rafting!

          many projects of my own, as I hope and plan to eventually have a
          career as a <i>professional Software Developer</i>. My future plans
          involve cultivating and perfecting my personal habits and skills so
          that I can become a high-performing, man of God. I will work on my
          professional and social skills so that I will be able to
